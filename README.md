# U-Net-based-image-quantification-of-epithelial-cell-shapes

Based on the idea to compute unbiased measurements for immunofluorescence images a multi-step
image processing pipeline was developed. This system replaced the error-prone and time-consuming
analysis by hand that couldnâ€™t provide numerical values for the image characteristics. The methods
can be used to evaluate immunofluorescence images stained with antibodies against ZO-1. The documentation
file should serve as a step-by-step instruction to process and analyze own image-datasets. 

For more detailed information on the methods and the theoretical background please have a look at our paper (pending).
